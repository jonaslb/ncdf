Every section in this part lists the change of the versions

* Dictionary

The dictionary will make use of the var format for retaining any type of
data. This will allow for greater structure etc.

** Rely on libvar.a rather than chars <2013-11-11 Mon>
The dictionary values are now the type(var) which eases
the interfacing between different segments of the code.
We allow to fully utilise the "assign" and "associate"
function calls in the assignment of the dictionary by following the 
operators:
   .KV. (assign)
   .KPV. (associate)

* Feature

** <2013-08-29 Thu>

- [ ] Variable filling of specific values
      I.e. add arguments to ncdf_def_var, etc
- [ ] <<inq_fill>> Adding FILL to the inquiry routines
      ncdf_inq(ncdf,...)

- [ ] [[inq_fill]] Consider changing the routine name ncdf_fill
      to something more meaning full
      Should probably be deprecated when implementing
      the inquiry fill statement
