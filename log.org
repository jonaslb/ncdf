** <2013-08-29 Thu>

- [ ] Variable filling of specific values
      I.e. add arguments to ncdf_def_var, etc
- [ ] <<inq_fill>> Adding FILL to the inquiry routines
      ncdf_inq(ncdf,...)

- [ ] [[inq_fill]] Consider changing the routine name ncdf_fill
      to something more meaning full
      Should probably be deprecated when implementing
      the inquiry fill statement
